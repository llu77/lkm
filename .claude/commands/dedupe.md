You are tasked with analyzing a GitHub issue to detect if it's a duplicate of existing issues in the repository.

## Multi-Step Analysis Process

Follow these steps carefully, thinking through each stage before proceeding:

### Step 1: Data Collection

1. **Extract the issue URL** from the user's message (format: `owner/repo/issues/123`)
2. **Fetch the target issue details** using bash with curl and the GitHub API:
   - Issue number, title, and body
   - Labels, state, and creation date
   - Author information
3. **Fetch all open issues** from the same repository (up to 100):
   - Use: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=open&per_page=100`
   - Authentication: `Authorization: token ${GH_TOKEN}`

### Step 2: Initial Analysis with Structured Thinking

Before making any conclusions, analyze the issue systematically in the following XML tags:

```xml
<issue_summary>
Summarize the core problem, feature request, or question in 2-3 sentences.
Include key technical details like:
- Error messages or stack traces
- Specific features mentioned
- Environment details (if any)
- User's goal or expected behavior
</issue_summary>

<comparison_analysis>
For each potentially similar issue, write:
- Issue number and title
- Key similarities (be specific)
- Key differences (be honest about these)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low) with reasoning

Think carefully: Are these TRULY duplicates or just related topics?
</comparison_analysis>

<verification>
Double-check your analysis:
- Could the issues be different aspects of the same problem?
- Could they be related but distinct issues?
- Is there enough evidence to confidently call something a duplicate?
- Remember: It's better to miss a duplicate than to incorrectly mark distinct issues as duplicates
</verification>

<final_decision>
List ONLY the issues that are clear duplicates with HIGH confidence.
If no clear duplicates exist, state: "No clear duplicates found."
</final_decision>
```

### Step 3: Action Decision

Based on your `<final_decision>`:

- **If clear duplicates found**: Post a helpful comment (see format below)
- **If no clear duplicates found**: Do NOT post any comment - this is perfectly fine and expected!

### Step 4: Posting Comment (Only if duplicates found)

Use the GitHub API to post a comment with this format:

```markdown
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I've analyzed this issue and found some potential duplicates:

### High Confidence
- #123 - [Issue Title] - [Specific reason: similar error message, same feature request, etc.]

### Medium Confidence
- #456 - [Issue Title] - [Specific reason for lower confidence]

**Note**: If this issue has unique aspects or differs from the above, please help us understand what makes it distinct. We want to make sure all unique issues stay open!

## Critical Guidelines

1. **Think step-by-step**: Use the XML tags to reason through your analysis - don't jump to conclusions
2. **Be conservative**: Only flag issues as duplicates if you have HIGH confidence
3. **It's okay to find nothing**: Most issues are NOT duplicates - this is the expected outcome
4. **Be specific**: When identifying duplicates, cite specific similarities (error messages, feature names, etc.)
5. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If API calls fail, explain the error and don't post comments
   - If rate limited, acknowledge it gracefully
   - If the issue is already closed, don't comment

## API Reference

GitHub API v3 endpoints:
- Get issue: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`
- List issues: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=open&per_page=100`
- Post comment: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments`

Authentication header: `Authorization: token ${GH_TOKEN}`

## Example of Good Analysis

```xml
<issue_summary>
User reports a 500 error when uploading files larger than 10MB. Error occurs consistently in production but not locally. Stack trace shows "MaxUploadSizeExceeded" exception.
</issue_summary>

<comparison_analysis>
Issue #145 "File upload fails":
- Similarities: Both about file upload failures, both mention size limits
- Differences: #145 occurs at 5MB, shows different error message ("NetworkTimeout"), happens locally too
- Confidence: LOW - These seem related but distinct (different size thresholds, different errors)

Issue #298 "500 error on large file upload":
- Similarities: Exact same error message ("MaxUploadSizeExceeded"), same 10MB threshold, same production-only behavior
- Differences: #298 mentions images specifically, this issue mentions all file types
- Confidence: HIGH - Core problem is identical, file type difference is minor detail
</comparison_analysis>

<verification>
Issue #298 appears to be a true duplicate - same error, same threshold, same environment. The file type difference doesn't change the underlying problem. Issue #145 is related but distinct due to different error and threshold.
</verification>

<final_decision>
Clear duplicate: #298
No comment needed for: #145 (related but not duplicate)
</final_decision>
```
